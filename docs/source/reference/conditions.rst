.. jcoad:condition:: partyHas[searchFor|collections|copyright|eggGroups|evolutions|slot|species|tags|types|mon]

    1 if the condition is true, 0 otherwise.
    
    This only accepts 1 param, a string containing multiple sub parameters.

    The conditional string accepts a wide array of potential values.
    
    Each condition is separated by &, and is treated as an "and" conditionally.
    
    Most/all conditions can be used multiple times (just not "searchFor")

    Spacing is allowed if it helps legibility, though avoid using it in the value for the "mon" condition.
    
    ``if partyHas[searchfor=any & evolutions = 1 & slot = 1]``
    
    Is a valid value, and translates to "Any mon in the party that has an immediate evo and is in the first slot."

    Below is documentation for each sub parameter/conditional capable of being used.

    .. param:: searchFor

        Accepts "any" or "all" as valid values.
        
        Defaults to "any" if not specified at all.

        Preferably the first condition, this specifies how the condition should behave.

        "any" - Find if there is ANY mon in the party that meets ALL the conditions in this check.

        "all" - Check to see that ALL mons in the party meet ALL the conditions in this check.

        ``if partyHas[searchfor=all&type=bug]``

        Would be 'true' if the player's party is entirely pokemon that are at least bug type.

    .. param:: collections

        Accepts any number of UIDs of collections the mon/mons may be from, separated by commas.

        If specified, no matter how many acceptable collections are provided, the mon/mons must belong to AT LEAST ONE of them.

        ``if partyHas[collections=10f6gxci,10hvquu7]``
        
        Would be "Any mon that is in the HUB OR Rica collections"

    .. param:: copyright

        Whether or not the mon/mons should be copyright.

        Often used to identify Nintendo mons.

        ``if partyHas[copyright=1]``

        Would mean "if the player's party has ANY copyright mon"

    .. param:: eggGroups

        Accepts names of egg groups separated by commas.

        The egg groups you want the mon/mons to belong to.

        ``if partyHas[eggGroups=mineral,water 2,field]``
        
        Would be "Any mon that belongs to AT LEAST ONE of the egg groups: mineral, water 2, or field"
    
    .. param:: evolutions

        Accepts whole numbers or whole numbers that are preceeded by ``>,>=,<,<=``

        The number of IMMEDIATE evolutions the mon/mons should have.

        ``if partyHas[evolutions=>=1]``

        Would be "Any mon that has one or more possible immediate evolutions

    .. param:: slot

        Accepts whole numbers (1 to 6) or whole numbers (1 to 6) that are preceeded by ``>,>=,<,<=``

        The slot the mon should be in.

        Do not attempt to use this with searchfor=all as it will not work.

        ``if partyHas[slot=>=4]``
        
        Would be "any mon exists in the 4th, 5th and 6th slots."

        ``if partyHas[slot=4&type=ground]``

        Would be "If the player has a ground type in their 4th slot"

    .. param:: species

        Accepts any species UIDs OR species names.

        If specified, no matter how many UIDs are provided, the mon/mons must belong to AT LEAST ONE of them, not ALL of them.

        ``if partyHas[species=0027xe3s]``
        
        Would be "any mon that is EXACTLY this SPECIFIC trapinch species that matches this UID"

        ``if partyHas[species=Trapinch]``

        Would be "any mon that is ANY species named Trapinch"

    .. param:: tags

        Accepts any string values separated by commas.

        The tags the mon should have in the pokengine database site.

        If specified, no matter how many tags are provided, the mon/mons must belong to AT LEAST ONE of them, not ALL of them.

        Tags ARE case sensitive here.

        ``if partyHas[tags=King,knight]``

        Would be "If the party has any mon that has the tag 'King' OR 'knight' "

    .. param:: types

        Accepts any number of types by name separated by commas.

        If specified, no matter how many types are provided, the mon/mons must belong to AT LEAST ONE of them, not ALL of them.

        ``if partyHas[types=bug]``

        Would be "any mon that has the type bug"

        ``if partyHas[types=bug,ground]``

        Would be "any mon that has the type bug OR ground"

        ``if partyHas[types=bug&type=ground]``

        Would be "any mon that has the type bug AND ground"

        ``if partyHas[searchfor=all&types=bug,ground]``

        Would be "All mons in party are at least bug OR at least ground"

        ``if partyHas[searchfor=all&types=bug&types=ground]``

        Would be "All mons in party are at least bug AND ground"

    .. param:: mon

        Accepts a value very similar to a mon generation string, with a few slight variances.

        Each of these sub-conditions are separated by ; and their sub-sub-condition values are separated by commas (see the ivs in the examples below)

        level / lv / l - mon level, accepts whole numbers and >,>=,<=,<

        nickname / name / n - the mon's name (or nickname if set)

        male / m - the mon's gender being male

        female / f - the mon's gender being female

        status / q - the mon's status, accepts status like "poison" and "paralyze" etc.

        nature / p - nature the mon should have, accepts whole text like 'hardy'

        moves / o - moves the mon should have AT LEAST ONE of, move UIDs separated by commas

        egg / y - number of egg steps remaining till hatch, accepts whole numbers and >,>=,<=,<

        IVs / ivs / i - IVs the mon should have, accepts whole numbers and >,>=,<=,< or # for 'any'

        EVs / evs / e - EVs the mon should have, accepts whole numbers and >,>=,<=,< or # for 'any'

        baseStats - Stats the mon's species should have, accepts whole numbers and >,>=,<=,< or # for 'any'

        rainbow - if the mon should be rainbow, accepts just "rainbow" no value

        golden - if the mon should be rainbow, accepts just "golden" no value

        shiny - if the mon should be rainbow, accepts just "shiny" no value

        steps - if the mon should have a number of steps, accepts whole numbers and >,>=,<=,<

        uid / u - The UID of the species the mon should be. Accepted if no key before:


        ``if partyHas[searchFor=any&mon=male;status poison;IVs 31,>=15,#,#,#,0]``
        
        Would be "any male mon that is poisoned, has exactly 31 HP iv and at least 15 attack iv, exactly 0 iv, with any other ivs."
        Similar syntax would be used for specifying evs.
